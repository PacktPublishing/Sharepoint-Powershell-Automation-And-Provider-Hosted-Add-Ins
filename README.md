## About the Video Course
In the second volume, we will first cover the PowerShell command pack from the PnP repository, exploring the various capabilities it offers. We will focus on site modification, site collection, and site provisioning techniques. Next we will cover provider-hosted add-ins and take a look at what they have to offer on top of SP-hosted add-ins. We’ll convert a project from an SP-hosted one into a provider-hosted one and set up sample event reactive code using the WebHooks SDK.

Lastly, we’ll take a look at Office 365’s unified Graph API, which allows developers to connect to a range of varying Office 365 APIs in a unified manner, using a single API access token.
